# AI-for-Localization
Some Materials on Kalman Filters, Particle Filters and SLAM

# Hello world!

Below you can find a list with useful sources, which will be perfect guidance on your journey in the world of Probabilistic Robotics.
The materials are mainly about robott localization and include books, papers, GitHub repos and so much more. We will do our best to keep
the list growing.

<b>Reading Materials</b>

1. An awesome book on Probability and Robotics from Sebastian Thrun. Here you can dive deep into the mathematics behind robot localization. Also you can find
useful pseudo-codes that you can apply to your favourite language. - <a href="https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf">Here</a>

2. Cool PhD work on SLAM with experimental results - <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub4/montemerlo_michael_2003_1/montemerlo_michael_2003_1.pdf">Here</a>

3. Thorough review of Particle Filter applications - <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/heuristics-and-hyper-heuristics-principles-and-applications/advanced-particle-filter-methods">Here</a>

4. Some slides on Kalman filter - <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~leparker/Courses/CS594-fall08/Lectures/Nov-20-Localization-Mapping-III.pdf">Here</a>

5. NB!! Bulgarian source!! PhD work on Robotics that includes not only localization, but also face recognition algorithms. - 
<a href="http://www.iict.bas.bg/konkursi/2017/DChikurtev/Avtoreferat.pdf">Here</a>

6. Quick review for main localization techniques - <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/self-driving-car-localization-f800d4d8da49">Here</a>

<b>GitHub Repos</b>

1. The book we started with. In the following repo you can find a Jupyter notebook review of all algorithms, that manage to combine mathematics,
cool examples and Python code - <a href="https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python">Here</a> 

2. Visualization for different localization techniques along with Python code - <a href="https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics">Here</a>

3. Google Cartographer repo - <a href="https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer">Here</a>

4. Localization in a Finite State Machines game (Python code) - <a href="https://github.com/salimchedrawi/Python-AI-Robots">Here</a>

<b>Videos</b>

1. The coolest SLAM course in University of Freiburg. Kudos to Cyrill Stachniss - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGQrZ4O5QzbIHgl3b1JHimN_">Here</a>
